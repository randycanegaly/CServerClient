# CServerClient
A server and client in C. Building this via incremental implementation I-squared. I-squared is intended to drag you up the ladder out of tutorial hell. See below.
1. Define the project, generally what will it do?
2. List all the features, specifically.
3. Break the list of features down into a smaller list of subfeatures, functions or code snippets, in order of implementation. Each should be easier to investigate, understand and implement

   a. If I am stuck and don't know how to start, break the problem item into smaller pieces again
5. Implement each item in #3 above, from top to bottom, During implementation, consult documentation or sources as needed to understand what needs done. **But stay away from examples that show exactly how to do it.** Each of these should be done in a way that promotes discovery, application and true learning. Stay away from Grok showing exactly how a thing should be done. Stay away from tutorials. Following and copying what someone else did doesn't engage the mind, doesn't teach. Trying, failing, correcting, trying, failing ...... teaches.
6. When a logical chunk is implemented, go back and modify, play, add depth. Add, change and break it. Then dig your way out.
7. Use a debugger. Use a debugger. Use a debugger.
